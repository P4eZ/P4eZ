This account is used as a way to showcase cybersecurity specific applications for academic use only. The types of applications found here are primarily command line
interface (CLI) tools for administrative maintenence or offensive/defensive cybersecurity operations. I do not condone, accept, or encourage any illegal use of these
tools in any form. All users are responsible for their own actions.

Hello, welcome to my repository! I am P4eZ, a current cybersecurity student practicing & teaching cybersecurity concepts through software development. The applications 
I post are mainly for:
  - Career development
  - Project-orientated learning
  - Academic practice
  - Coding expirience
  - Teaching basic concepts
  - Pure FUN!

Have a look around and expiriment with the code for yourself. Feel free to build off of the code and make it your own. I do my best to explain the concepts within the
code using comments. Most applications will be written using Python 3 and will follow PEP8 standards. 


Thank you for visiting!
