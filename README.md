This account is used as a way to showcase cybersecurity specific applications for academic use only. The types of applications found here are primarily command line
interface (CLI) tools for administrative maintenence or offensive/defensive cybersecurity operations. I do not condone or encourage any illegal use of these
tools in any form. All users are responsible for their own actions.

Hello, welcome to my repository! I am P4eZ (pronounced for-eh-z), a current cybersecurity student practicing cybersecurity concepts through software development. The goal of Project P4eZ is to learn, develop, and teach security in a project-oritentated environment. Learning information security by practically applying concepts can
expand technical and conceptual capabilities. Here are some of the reasons why Project P4eZ was started:
  - Career development advancement
  - Project-orientated learning
  - Conceptual understanding of cybersecurity practices
  - Basic software development practice
  - Teach others about cybersecurity concepts (encryption, offensive/defensive security, networking)
  - Pure FUN!

The goal is to learn and explain cybersecurity concepts in an interactive way. The code may not be the most effecient in performing a task, so feel free to change the code and add to it.

Have a look around and expiriment with the code for yourself. I do my best to explain the concepts within the code inside the README files. Most applications will be written using Python 3 and will follow PEP8 standards. The applications here will be peer-reviewed by others including cybersecurity professionals, professors, and other cyber students to ensure the concepts are correct. Contributors will be acknowledged at the beginning of the main file.


Thank you for visiting!
